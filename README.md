# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Random Forest for Heart Disease Classification

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in combination with Random Forest for the classification of heart disease. The goal of this project is to leverage the power of dimensionality reduction with PCA and the predictive strength of Random Forest to create an effective model for identifying and classifying heart disease.

## Introduction

Principal Component Analysis is a technique commonly used for dimensionality reduction in machine learning. In this project, we apply PCA to a dataset containing various features related to heart health. The reduced set of principal components is then used as input to a Random Forest classifier to predict the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [provide_dataset_source]. It includes a variety of features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical indicators.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-pca-random-forest.git
cd heart-disease-pca-random-forest
```

2. Install the required dependencies (see [Requirements](#requirements)).

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook `heart_disease_pca_random_forest.ipynb` to see the step-by-step implementation of PCA and Random Forest for heart disease classification.

2. Modify the notebook or Python scripts to experiment with different hyperparameters, feature engineering, or preprocessing steps.

## Results

The results of the classification model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are presented in the notebook and can be visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
